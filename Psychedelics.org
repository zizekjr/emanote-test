I have been obssessed with Psychedelics for years now and having tried LSD twice, I have to say, these substances are worth pursuing from a scientific POV, sure pharamaceuticals company will have a dent in their pockets in the short term but these substances will only line their pockets long term if they fund the much needed research in the field.
